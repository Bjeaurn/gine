# Contributing to Gine

Well, I have no rules as of now. But make sure you don't change anything fundamental to the build without any good reasons. Don't swap out or add plugins without consulting with the rest of community first by opening up an issue.

Other than that, create a Pull Request with as little changes possible (this makes it easier to review and oversee any effects). Make sure you are aware of any breaking changes and you mark these clearly in your PR. 

In general, make sure to write a good description of the intended effects. Include issue numbers if they are relevant.

Other then that, use your common sense! And I, and I'm sure any users of this software will be greatly thankful for your work and service!
