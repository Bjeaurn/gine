# Gine2

Gine2 is a HTML5 Canvas/JavaScript game engine, rebuilt for TypeScript with full type support. 

### How to install

`git clone <git url>`

`npm install`

For developer mode (Hot Reloading enabled):
`npm run dev`

To build:
`npm run build`

The result will be in `dist/`, be careful: Webpack turns it into 1 big file, this might change over time as we change some of the settings.
