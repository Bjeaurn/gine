# Todo's for Gine v2

Y - Put back full screen (full window) `scaling`.

? Done ? - Implement `Camera`

Y - Check out what's in `Screen` and put that in `Canvas` probably.

- `Image` loading, storing, retrieving.
- ### IMPORTANT ### Handle is now a closed function, we don't want to create multiple Handle instances to use `draw()`
- `HUD` management. Enable/Disable debugging from the engine, not the game.
- `Scene` management? Make sure we can start building levels and games.
- ??? `Sprites` expansion upon the `Image`???
