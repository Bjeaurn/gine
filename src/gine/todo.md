# Todo's for Gine v3
[Done]
Y - Put back full screen (full window) `scaling`.
Y - Check out what's in `Screen` and put that in `Canvas` probably.
Y - `Image` loading, storing, retrieving.
Y - ### IMPORTANT ### Handle is now a closed function, we don't want to create multiple Handle instances to use `draw()`
Y - `Scene` management? Make sure we can start building levels and games.

[Todo]
- Implement `Camera`
- `HUD` management. Enable/Disable debugging from the engine, not the game.
- `Sprite` management expansion upon the `Image`???
